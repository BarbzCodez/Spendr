Discussion on which user stories we need/want to have for sprint 3.
- we want to have something flashy but not too much work on our end
- deleting budget notification
- may need to remove the category for budget, or change it to not be the current enum. Rather monthly, weekly, and annual
- backend fill out data automatically based on monthly weekly, and annual
- A user can set up a total of 3 budgets, monthly, weekly, and annual budgets
  - They can put it in a weekly budget, then it would go into the annual and monthly budget.
  - We can just say that they dont choose which budget it goes into. Can just go into all of them
  - Dan picturing budgets: You can add a budget for every month, everytime you add an entertainment expense it adds it to that budget
  - If you have 20 budget it will have a lot of fetches and calls between the front and backend.
  - Settled on having categories and date length (only during creation)
    - wont be influeced or changed by other budgets. Each budgets are siloed
- May have to re-write user categories with budgets. Change the categories and weekly, monthly, and annual for each budget separately, but on the same budget.
- Expenses will automatically go into the budget of the same category

Analytics
- Would want to show all expenses for the last 30 days.
  - May not be any different that the original user story which is visualizing expenses
  - first user story shows expenses regardless for a certain time period
- Does not make a ton of difference if the time range was determined by the user, and if it was preset
- User stories overlap a tiny bit, rephrasing the stories to better reflect what we are working on
- Have a drop down of months with 2 plots on the graphs that visualize those two months
  - alerts are monthly based and show up when you select that month. Gives comparisons between the two months
  - This month and one you can choose to compare to
  - cautious about the framing and which time come first
- Alerts are just saying its up or down visually. Display the numbers.
- Difference between stories, one is a bar graph, one is a time plot, one is the text
- If we need to customize the response on the backend then it could need a lot of work and back and forth
  - Return each day of the month, squash together all of the expenses together
  - endpoint total daily expenses
    - send two dates
    - send a category (or list of categories)
    - returns total amount of spending for everyday between those two days, daily time resolution

Expense Analytics user categories (1-4)
1.
  - for current month, same as 2 but for current month
  - 1st of month to whatever date it is
  - If its oct. 2 then it returns oct 1 and 2
2.
  - Compare completed months
  - Have two months side by side that you can compare
  - time plot, comparing two different month graphs
3. 
  - bar graph, breaks down the expenses by categories
  - Nothing to do with specific days, its about categories
4.
 - text based percentage difference
 - same component/page as #2

API: start date, end date, return daily expenses (No categories)
In the middle layer sum the daily expenses and divide by number of days
API: start date, end date, return expenses per category over whole time frame

Group splitting:
We need to have users have to have the app to be added to the group budget
- each user has to add themselves as paid
- No editing of expense
