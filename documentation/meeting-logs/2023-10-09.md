User management feature. User authentication is done. Tokens are being passed to clients. Middle layer is authenticating those requests. Tests to cover them. (https://github.com/BarbzCodez/Spendr/issues/20) (https://github.com/BarbzCodez/Spendr/issues/18)

Prisma interface between sql and code. Simplifies the database management. Queries are in prisma. Diagram for db.

Separating work for drawing into designing it and creating a deliverable. Dan will draw the diagrams for the database/information flow. (https://github.com/BarbzCodez/Spendr/issues/29) 

PR up for frontend stuff. Victoria and Barb working on that. Working on user settings, wants api calls to do that. Setting up table for expenses history. Finishing before test on Thursday. (https://github.com/BarbzCodez/Spendr/issues/28) (https://github.com/BarbzCodez/Spendr/issues/27) (https://github.com/BarbzCodez/Spendr/issues/26)

Users interface: {
name: string
security-question: string
security-answer: string
token: string
}

Should we transfer the token to the front end or should we hold it in the middle layer because it does not need to be rendered in the front end.

API is going to be simple enough that it should be very easy understand to know what is going on or which calls are going to return what. Should describe the API enough that the backend and the front end can communicate even if they get out of sync. Reduce the amount of double work and work doubling back we have to do.

API documentation file in the repo. Chuck API documentation in architecture.

Comments on functions. Defining expected behavior of functions so that people know when they call it what are the endpoints that they touch as well as the input and the output of the headers. Comments above functions. Keep this consistent and always comment function headers. JSdoc syntax, extracts all @ params to a html doc. Make sure that PR reviews point out lacks of documentation.

This week completing frontend, CI/CD (backend only). Try to complete this this week if possible. Give a buffer of a few days (or a week) before its done. (https://github.com/BarbzCodez/Spendr/issues/12)

PR merges done by Monday (Oct. 16).
