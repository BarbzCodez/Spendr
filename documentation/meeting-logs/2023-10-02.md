We have 4 weeks to work on this sprint

Sprint 2 evaluation is due in 3 weeks, October 20th.

- Sprint 3 is 4 weeks
- large portion of the sprints are going to be done in sprint 2 and 3

Regression Tests (Need to run tests that are ran after ever feature is merged)

100% code coverage, need to cover the entirety of the typescript express.JS

Front end testing

- Cypress, swift
- stub the data and then click on things and verify that the front end flow is correct

Differentiated between front end and back end testing because the jobs are different enough

- Victoria gets front end testing manager

Discussion on padding and specific front end designs. Talked about which design was the nicest to look at.

- Used Figma to create front end prototype
  - designing for [User login #22](https://github.com/BarbzCodez/Spendr/issues/22) and [User registration #21](https://github.com/BarbzCodez/Spendr/issues/21)
- Talked about colour choices
- dark mode only
- welcome page/sign up page
- Figma has a function to export code snippets. It can be jank though
- MaterialUI or charkha UI will probably be the react component libraries used

Some compiling problems

- some node library wasn't loading (ESLint wasn't working)
- Just run it twice

Sequence Diagram

- Mark can do it
- create flow of data through the core features
- sooner rather than later
- do all 5 sequence diagrams but do the first 3 first so people can get working on that
