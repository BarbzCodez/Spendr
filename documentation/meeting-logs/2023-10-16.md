## Notes

- Ethan finished the express logging and prisma model for our database for all features. (https://github.com/BarbzCodez/Spendr/issues/14)
- Barbara got the initial UI for viewing the expenses and user settings, and is now working on integrating user settings UI with the Express API. (https://github.com/BarbzCodez/Spendr/issues/26) (https://github.com/BarbzCodez/Spendr/pull/55)
- Daniel finished express API for auth and expenses with full code coverage, fixed the docker issues, created CI workflow, and sequence diagrams. (https://github.com/BarbzCodez/Spendr/issues/12) (https://github.com/BarbzCodez/Spendr/issues/52) (https://github.com/BarbzCodez/Spendr/issues/12) (https://github.com/BarbzCodez/Spendr/issues/8)
- Victoria finished registration, login, logout in the frontend with full integration, and is now working on the Expenses UI and integration (add, edit, delete, list). (https://github.com/BarbzCodez/Spendr/issues/21) (https://github.com/BarbzCodez/Spendr/pull/70) (https://github.com/BarbzCodez/Spendr/issues/26) (https://github.com/BarbzCodez/Spendr/issues/60) (https://github.com/BarbzCodez/Spendr/issues/61)
- Mark is working on CD workflow to automatically build and publish the Docker images to Docker Hub with GitHub Actions- needs to get the secrets from GitHub (https://github.com/BarbzCodez/Spendr/issues/12)

- Need to add a feature, will likely need to add a user story to get full marks
- Don't need 5 users per feature, so we only have to make a subset of the user stories implemented

- Discussed the rubric

- Need to add the meeting notes to github wiki as well as have it in the repo

- "0.5 Meet at least two time and 0.25 for each. have a wiki page about meeting minutes and document the summary in corresponding github issues."
  - do we need to link issues to the meetings?
  - Reference github issues in the wiki

- When should Dan review on the expenses PR?
  - Had to wait to work on it because of overlapping work in the PRs (https://github.com/BarbzCodez/Spendr/issues/26) (https://github.com/BarbzCodez/Spendr/issues/60) (https://github.com/BarbzCodez/Spendr/issues/61)
  - Since Barbara and Victoria are working on separate things now they can work efficiently
