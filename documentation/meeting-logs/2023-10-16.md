- Need to add a feature, will likely need to add a user story to get full marks
- Don't need 5 users per feature, so we only have to make a subset of the user stories implemented

- Discussed the rubric

- Need to add the meeting notes to github wiki as well as have it in the repo

- "0.5 Meet at least two time and 0.25 for each. have a wiki page about meeting minutes and document the summary in corresponding github issues."
  - do we need to link issues to the meetings?
  - Reference github issues in the wiki

- When should Dan review on the expenses PR?
  - Had to wait to work on it because of overlapping work in the PRs [Add expense #26](https://github.com/BarbzCodez/Spendr/issues/26) [Edit Expense #60](https://github.com/BarbzCodez/Spendr/issues/60) [Delete Expense #61](https://github.com/BarbzCodez/Spendr/issues/61)
  - Since Barbara and Victoria are working on separate things now they can work efficiently
