- Daniel finished express API for auth and expenses with full code coverage, fixed the docker issues, created CI workflow, and sequence diagrams.
- Victoria finished registration, login, logout in the frontend with full integration, and is now working on the Expenses UI and integration (add, edit, delete, list).
- Mark is working on CD worfklow to automatically build and publish the Docker images to Docker Hub with GitHub Actions- needs to get the secrets from GitHub

- Need to add a feature, will likely need to add a user story to get full marks
- Don't need 5 users per feature, so we only have to make a subset of the user stories implemented

- Discussed the rubric

- Need to add the meeting notes to github wiki as well as have it in the repo

- "0.5 Meet at least two time and 0.25 for each. have a wiki page about meeting minutes and document the summary in corresponding github issues."
  - do we need to link issues to the meetings?
  - Reference github issues in the wiki

- When should Dan review on the expenses PR?
  - Had to wait to work on it because of overlapping work in the PRs
  - Since Barbara and Victoria are working on separate things now they can work efficiently
